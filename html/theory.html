                <h2>Present Simple</h2>
                <p> 
                    I suppose we start off with present tenses. Prsent Simple is all about generalization. When someone uses present simple he assumes that that thing probably
                    isn't happening right now but instead happens on a general basis(with some verbs we can use this tense in the sense though). When i say i work at that company
                    i don't mean i'm working right now at the moment of speech, i just do it every day. That pretty much the essence of the tense(it's just an example for a template don't judge it too harshly)
